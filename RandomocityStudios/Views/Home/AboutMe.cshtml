            I wrote my first "Hello World" console application over 15 years ago, and a few degrees and thousands of lines of code later,
            I work professionally as a Software Engineer. I live in Bellingham, Washington with my Fiancé, three black cats, and a German Shepherd.
            Some of my hobbies include longboarding, snowboarding, hiking, biking, motorcycling, canoeing, swimming, gardening, programming (yes, for leisure too!), writing and drawing.

            I'm a Blockchain enthusiast, and have been running a "mining rig" out of my office for a few years now. I believe that the technology will eventually be used to overcome
            some of the pitfalls in our legacy banking systems, and I want to be HODLing when that time comes.

            I'm learning about OpenGL and React right now, and I plan to use them to make a suite of educational games aimed at teaching math and programming to children.
            I'm more passionate about the more classical computer science, back-end, algorithmic programming, but I find a lot of enjoyment in being able to develop across the entire stack
