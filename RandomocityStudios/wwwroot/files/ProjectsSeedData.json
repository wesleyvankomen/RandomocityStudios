Between starting work at a new company, getting a new puppy, and trying to survive the pandemic, I haven't been writing as much code in my leisure time as I would like! Speaking of puppy, meet Elvis the Corgidor (Corgi + Labrador). He is a ball of energy that often distracts me from working on my math rpg game, but that is okay because he is so adorable! On the math rpg front, I will be launching a beta version of the game soon. Contact me via Linkedin or RandomocityStudios at the Gmail dot com -- you know the one.",
